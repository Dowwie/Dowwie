# Intro 

Hi! I'm Darin.

I've spent many years navigating unfamiliar territory, taking on great challenges and excelling. I do not seek comfortable, familiar opportunities that I am good at but those of great challenge, opportunity, and growth.  I'm founding a real-estate/property tech venture that I’d love to talk with you about!

My dog's name is Denali.  She's a german wirehaired pointer.
