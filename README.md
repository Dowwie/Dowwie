# Intro 

Hi! I'm Darin.

I've spent many years navigating unfamiliar territory, acquiring the skills and expertise required to lead.  I do not seek comfortable, familiar opportunities that I am good at but those of great challenge, opportunity, and growth.  I am the founder of a real-estate/property tech venture that Iâ€™d love to talk with you about!  We can build the future together.

My dog's name is Denali.  She's a german wirehaired pointer.  Her favorite programming languages are Rust and Python.
